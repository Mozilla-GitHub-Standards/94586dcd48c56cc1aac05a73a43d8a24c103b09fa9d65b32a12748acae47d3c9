# high-fidelity #

high-fidelity is an offline-capable, entirely HTML5/JS podcasts app. It's
chiefly designed for Firefox OS, but support for other platforms and browsers
is an eventual design goal. It requires a datastore that supports large files;
currently, we just use IndexedDB.

The app requires elevated XMLHttpRequest privileges to fetch podcast files.
In Firefox OS, this currently means being installed as a packaged app. Details
for other platforms forthcoming.
