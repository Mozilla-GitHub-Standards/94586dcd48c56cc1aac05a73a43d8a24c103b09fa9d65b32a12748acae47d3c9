# high-fidelity, Mark II

high-fidelity is an offline-capable, entirely HTML5/JS podcasts app. It's
chiefly designed for Firefox OS, but support for other platforms and browsers
is an eventual design goal. It requires a datastore that supports large files;
currently, we just use IndexedDB.

This is an experimental, rewrite branch using Ember.js and Mozilla's recroom.
